## Overview

The Tecnojund website was recreated from scratch with the goal of modernizing the brand, improving user experience, and increasing lead conversion.

With the new `/chamados` page, this need was addressed, resulting in a significant increase in organic traffic, lead generation, and the closing of new contracts.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Introduction to the company and an overview of services.
- **Ticket Page**: Efficient form for ticket creation with email sending.
- **Downloads Page**: Page for downloading the software provided by the client.
